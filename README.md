# t-test hypothesis testing

In statistics, a t-test is a hypothesis test that is used to determine whether the means of two groups are statistically different from each other. It is often used to compare the means of a sample of data to a known value or to compare the means of two independent samples.

There are two main types of t-tests: the one-sample t-test and the two-sample t-test. The one-sample t-test is used to determine whether the mean of a sample is significantly different from a known population mean. The two-sample t-test, on the other hand, is used to determine whether the means of two independent samples are significantly different from each other.

The t-test is based on the t-distribution, which is a probability distribution that is similar to the normal distribution but is better suited for small sample sizes. The t-distribution has a parameter called degrees of freedom (df), which is based on the sample size and determines the shape of the distribution.

To conduct a t-test, we first state the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis is typically that there is no significant difference between the means of the two groups being compared, while the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference.

We then calculate the t-value using the formula:

t = (x1 - x2) / (s * sqrt(1/n1 + 1/n2))

where x1 and x2 are the means of the two groups being compared, s is the pooled standard deviation of the two groups, n1 and n2 are the sample sizes of the two groups, and sqrt is the square root function.

Once we have calculated the t-value, we determine its significance by comparing it to the critical values of the t-distribution. We can then calculate the p-value, which is the probability of obtaining a t-value as extreme or more extreme than the one we observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. If the p-value is less than the significance level (typically 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups being compared. Otherwise, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
